# Duara - Project Management Plan

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Duara (*"Circle"* in Kiswahili)

###  Description
Duara is a **student club management system** that connects students with campus clubs.  
It was developed to address the problems the school faces with its current manual, scattered, and inefficient club management system.  

By providing one unified platform for both students and club managers, Duara streamlines the process of discovering, joining, and managing clubs.

## Why Duara?

- The current system is **manual and disorganized**, forcing students to rely on posters and word-of-mouth.  
- There is **no central platform** for discovering or joining clubs.  
- Club managers lack effective tools for **tracking membership and event participation**.  

 Duara solves these issues by **digitizing the entire process** into a clean, user-friendly system.
